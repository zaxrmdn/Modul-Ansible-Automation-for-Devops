> So we need to add a configuration in Ansible to bypass this, so that later if there is a new machine that we are going to control, there will be no more fingerprint checks.

### Add configuration ansible bypass fingerprint
```
$ vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
```
> The file configuration in this link [ansible.cfg](./ansible.cfg)

### Trying ping
```
$ ansible ubuntu1 -m ping -k
```
> Insert password ssh
```
